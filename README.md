# Context engineering ![](https://bonigarcia.dev/img/context-engineering.png)

**Context engineering** can be defined as the practice of designing systems that provide a Large Language Model (LLM) and AI agents with all the necessary information to complete a task effectively. It goes beyond prompt engineering since it focuses on building a comprehensive and structured context from various sources like system instructions, external knowledge, memory, tools, and state. The central idea is that the success of a complex LLM-based system depends more on the quality and completeness of the context provided than on the specific wording of the prompt itself.

Tobi Lütke, the CEO of Shopify, coined the term _context engineering_ in a [tweet](https://x.com/tobi/status/1935533422589399127) on June 19, 2025. He defined context engineering as _the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM_. This novel concept captures the essence of the current evolution of LLM-based systems, inspiring others (like me) to understand and define this emerging engineering discipline. Since then, I've been working on a book entitled **Context engineering: the art and science of shaping context-aware AI systems**, to be published by [Manning](https://www.manning.com/) in 2026.

This GitHub repository is intended to be a companion resource for this book and a reference for practitioners looking to understand and adopt the context engineering principles.

_Warning_: This repository is a work in progress, so content and structure may change.

## Table of contents

This book aims to provide a strong, general-purpose theoretical foundation for context engineering, supported by hands-on examples. Its table of contents is the following:

1. Introduction to context engineering
2. System instructions
3. External knowledge and retrieval
4. Tools in AI agents
5. Memory and state
6. User prompts
7. Context management and orchestration
8. Evaluation and observability
9. Governance and operations
10. AI frameworks for context engineering
11. Context engineering for software development
12. State of the art on context engineering  
Appendix A. The AI ecosystem  
Appendix B. References and further reading

Each chapter of this book starts by explaining the underlying principles and patterns of each thematic block. Then, the final part of each chapter is devoted to presenting specific examples. This GitHub repository contains all these examples. Moreover, I will include new examples and maintain the existing ones even after the book is published. The goal is to provide an open-source, updated reference for everyone interested in context engineering.

## Examples

This repository organizes examples by chapter to help you explore context engineering concepts in practice.

#### Chapter 2. System instructions
This chapter covers the definition and usage of the system instructions (system prompts, agent skills, and instructions artifacts) as a foundation layer to shape the model behavior:
- OpenAI: [Python](./ch02/python/openai-gpt-system-prompt) · [Jupyter](./ch02/jupyter/openai_gpt_system_prompt.ipynb) · [JavaScript](./ch02/javascript/openai-gpt-system-prompt) · [Java](./ch02/java/src/main/java/io/github/bonigarcia/ce/OpenAiGptSystemPrompt.java)

#### Chapter 3. External knowledge and retrieval
This chapter explores different patterns for providing external knowledge to the model. It covers Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using different retrievers and models, Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG), and context stuffing (injecting data directly into the prompt):
