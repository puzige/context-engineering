# Context engineering ![](https://bonigarcia.dev/img/context-engineering.png)

**Context engineering** can be defined as the practice of designing systems that provide a Large Language Model (LLM) with all the necessary information to complete a task effectively. It goes beyond prompt engineering since it focuses on building a comprehensive and structured context from various sources like system instructions, external knowledge, memory, tools, and state. The central idea is that the success of a complex LLM-based system depends more on the quality and completeness of the context provided than on the specific wording of the prompt itself.

Tobi Lütke, the CEO of Shopify, coined the term _context engineering_ in a [tweet](https://x.com/tobi/status/1935533422589399127) on June 19, 2025. He defined context engineering as _the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM_. This novel concept captures the essence of the current evolution of LLM-based systems, inspiring others (like me) to understand and define this emerging engineering discipline. Since then, I've been working on a book entitled **Context engineering: the art and science of shaping context-aware AI systems**, to be published by [Manning](https://www.manning.com/) in 2026.

This GitHub repository is intended to be a companion resource for this book and a go-to reference for practitioners looking to understand and adopt the context engineering principles.

_Warning_: This repository is a work in progress, so content and structure may change.

## Table of contents

This book aims to provide a strong, general-purpose theoretical foundation for context engineering, supported by hands-on examples. Its table of contents is the following:

1. Introduction to context engineering
2. System instructions and user prompts
3. External knowledge and retrieval
4. Tools and memory in AI agents
5. State and orchestration in agentic systems
6. Context management, evaluation, and observability
7. AI frameworks for context engineering
8. Context engineering in real-world environments
9. Context engineering through the software development lifecycle
10. State of the art on context engineering  
Appendix A. The AI ecosystem  
Appendix B. References and further reading

Each chapter of this book starts by explaining the underlying principles and patterns of each thematic block. Then, the final part of each chapter is devoted to presenting specific examples. This GitHub repository contains all these examples. Moreover, I will include new examples and maintain the existing ones even after the book is published. The goal is to provide an open-source, updated reference for everyone interested in context engineering.

## Online tools

This repository includes interactive, browser-based tools that complement the book and help you apply context engineering concepts in practice.

### 1. Context-aware Prompt Builder

🔗 https://bonigarcia.dev/context-engineering/context-aware-prompt-builder.html

Design, compare, and reuse structured prompts across multiple frameworks and AI models.

Key capabilities:
- Build prompts using established frameworks (10-step, COSTAR, CRISPE, RTF, etc.)
- Switch frameworks dynamically while preserving intent
- Import/export prompts as JSON
- Measure approximate context usage for different models
- Load curated prompt samples for common SDLC roles

This tool is especially useful for **creating and iterating on prompts** in a structured, repeatable way.

---

### 2. SDLC Prompt Library

🔗 https://bonigarcia.dev/context-engineering/sdlc_prompt_library.html

Browse a curated library of prompts organized around the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

Included roles:
- Architect
- Developer
- Debugger
- Reviewer
- Refactorer
- Tester
- Documenter

Key capabilities:
- Explore prompts visually using a card-based interface
- Filter by framework (10-step, COSTAR, CRISPE, RTF)
- Inspect full structured prompts for each role
- Copy prompts directly for reuse or adaptation

This tool is designed as a **reference library**, helping you understand how structured prompts vary across roles and frameworks.


## Resources
Although the concept of _context engineering_ is new, the underlying technologies (LLMs, AI agents, prompt engineering, RAG, MCP, memory management, skills, etc.) have been developed over the years. Nevertheless, summarizing all these converging technologies and tools in a single book is a very challenging task. As you know, nowadays, there is more information than ever, and it is very easy to get lost with so many sources. This section summarizes some of the most relevant references and resources I found during my journey to unravel the essence of context engineering.
